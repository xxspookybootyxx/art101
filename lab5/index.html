					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were working on familiarizing ourselves with JavaScript!</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems arose! Everything seemed to work very smoothly.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had fun with this assignment! I don't have a car, and I try to walk everywhere that I can so I had my own take on the make and model, which just applied to a pair of my shoes!</p>
