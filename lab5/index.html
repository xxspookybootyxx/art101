                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I had fun with this assignment! I don't have a car, and I try to walk everywhere that I can, so I had my own take on the make and model, which just applied to a pair of my shoes!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <img class="pic1" id="pic1" src="./img/shoez.jpg" alt="Shoes" />
                <p>This is my preferred vehicle... they're starting to fall apart.</p>
            </div>
