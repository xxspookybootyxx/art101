                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>For this lab, we were working on familiarizing ourselves with JavaScript!</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had a ton of trouble getting the JS code to link properly to the HTML and i kept adding and changing things and then my code got super messy and so I had to run it through WesBot and then ChatGPT and it pointed out my errors which mostly happened because of how messy my code was. It seems to be working now though so yay.</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I had fun with this assignment! I don't have a car, and I try to walk everywhere that I can, so I had my own take on the make and model, which just applied to a pair of my shoes!</p>

                <img class="pic1" id="pic1" src="./img/shoez.jpg" alt="Shoes" />
                <p>This is my preferred vehicle... they're starting to fall apart.</p>
