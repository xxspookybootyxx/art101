					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge in this lab was to create a function that required user input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had no problems! This was a relatively straightforward lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I did the lab according to the assignment, but I don't love that the website prompts you to give your name before the webpage even shows up. I want to change that but I looked it up and if I do change it then I wont be coding according to the assignment.</p>
