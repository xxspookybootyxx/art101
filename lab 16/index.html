				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>In this lab, we familiarized ourselves with the file structures on our computers. We also worked on uploading things to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I struggled for a while to get the CSS code to change the size of my image, but then I found out that it was because I hadn't coded for an image ID in the HTML. Once I fixed that, everything seemed to work well!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I definitely put my full energy and attention into this assignment. Learning to code is hard! You do such simple things and yet it is so complicated. I definitely don't have code literacy yet, so it takes me forever to find the errors in my code because I don't intuitively know what I am looking at when I read my code.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<img class="pic1" id="pic1" src="./img/applerepo.png" alt="Local directory on my computer">
				<p>This is my local directory seen on my computer files.</p>
				<div id="output"></div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<img class="pic2" id="pic2" src="./img/websiteimg.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage">
				<p>This is how my homepage looks currently.</p>
				<div id="output"></div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<img class="pic3" id="pic3" src="./img/htmlss.png" alt="HTML code for homepage">
				<p>This is the HTML code for my homepage...</p>
				<div id="output"></div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<img class="pic4" id="pic4" src="./img/cssss.png" alt="CSS code for homepage">
				<p>And this is the CSS code for my homepage!</p>
