			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we familiarized ourselves with the file structures on our computers. We also worked on uploading things to the server</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled for a while to get the CSS code to change the size of my image, but then I found out that it was because I hadn't coded for an image ID in the HTML. Once I fixed that, everything seemed to work well!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I definitely put my full energy and attention into this assignment. Learning to code is hard! You do such simple things and yet it is so complicated. I definitely don't have code literacy yet, so it takes me forever to find the errors in my code because I don't intuitively know what I am looking at when I read my code.</p>
