					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge in this lab was to use jQuery and JavaScript to create buttons with a function that when pressed gave back a random snippet from the "Lorem Ipsum" sample text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any problems with this lab, except that I noticed that the generated Lorem Ipsum text wasn't clearing each new time it was generated, which I kind of liked actually because you could go back and see what you'd already generated, but I added a second button that you can press to clear all of the generated text.</p>
