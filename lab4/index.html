					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab is to learn how to pseudocode so that we can then use that as a tool when we are actually coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems! This lab was delightfully straightforward. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was pretty simple! My partner and I had fun coming up with our list for both the every day task and the game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>For our game, we decided to create a list of tasks for playing Rock, Paper, Scissors! It goes like this: </p>
					<p>//Rock, Paper, Scissors!
						//Have 2 players 
						//Pound 1 hand each 3x, synchronized 
						  //On each beat when hands make contact with one another both players say 
							//Rock, then
							//Paper, then
							//Scissors.
						//On the 4th beat both players each say shoot 
						//Simultaneously deciding & making the hand motion for either rock, paper, or scissors
						//Depending on the players’ selected hand motion one player is the winner
						  //Rock beats scissors
						  //Scissors beats paper 
						  //Paper beats rock</p>
					<p>... and here are the screenshots</p>
