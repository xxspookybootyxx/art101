//Rock, Paper, Scissors!
  //Have 2 players 
  //Pound 1 hand each 3x, synchronized 
    //On each beat when hands make contact with one another both players say 
      //Rock, then
      //Paper, then
      //Scissors.
  //On the 4th beat both players each say shoot 
  //Simultaneously deciding & making the hand motion for either rock, paper, or scissors
  //Depending on the playersâ€™ selected hand motion one player is the winner
    //Rock beats scissors
    //Scissors beats paper
    //Paper beats rock
