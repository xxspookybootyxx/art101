                <p>My name is Lucy Jordan and I am a 3rd year History of Art and Visual Culture/Anthropology student. I am from Washington, D.C, and being from a major city has conditioned in me a love of walking, biking, and exploring my geographical area.
                    My name is Liana Simonelli and I am a fifth-year Art major and feminist studies major. I am originally from San Diego, in Southern California. I love swimming and going to the beach with my dogs. I like making art from materials like rocks and clay.
                    We both love walking and exploring our cities on foot and we figured out that we both love hummus.</p>
