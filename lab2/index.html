			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to familiarize us with making and linking HTML and CSS files, as well as using CSS to beautify them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Both my partner and I are struggling to figure out how to get the CSS element of our websites to show up. We've both cross-referenced with LLM's and they tell us that our code is correct and that there could be an issue with the files, and neither of us know how to solve that. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think that, though we have not completely finished, Liana and I put a lot of inquisitive energy into the assignment. We are both definitely learning from little-to-no prior experience so we are still clumsy with code, but it is interesting (though infuriating) </p>
